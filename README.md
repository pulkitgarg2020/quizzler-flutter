# Quizzler ‚ùì

## The Goal

In this tutorial from LondonAppBrewery I reviewed Stateful and Stateless Widgets as well as learnt about the fundamental building blocks of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes and Objects. 


## What I created

A quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, you can create your own quiz for other people to enjoy!
